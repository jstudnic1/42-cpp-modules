# 42 School C++ Projects

This repository contains my solutions for the C++ modules from the 42 School curriculum.

## Modules

- CPP00: Namespaces, classes, member functions, stdio streams, initialization lists, static, const
- CPP01: Memory allocation, pointers to members, references, switch statement
- CPP02: Ad-hoc polymorphism, operator overloading and canonical classes

## Getting Started

Each module directory contains separate exercises. To compile an exercise, navigate to its directory and use the provided Makefile:

```bash
cd cpp00/ex00
make
```
