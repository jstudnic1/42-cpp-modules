I. Introduction

C++ is a general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming language (‚ÄúC with Classes‚Äù ‚Äî source: Wikipedia).

The goal of these modules is to introduce you to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) with C++.
We follow the C++98 standard for simplicity and compatibility.
Modern C++ differs significantly, so continue studying after the 42 Common Core to become a proficient developer.

II. General Rules

Compiling
	‚Ä¢	Compile with:
c++ -Wall -Wextra -Werror
	‚Ä¢	Code must also compile with:
-std=c++98

Formatting and Naming Conventions
	‚Ä¢	Directory names: ex00, ex01, ‚Ä¶, exn
	‚Ä¢	Class names: UpperCamelCase format.
	‚Ä¢	File names must match the class name (e.g., BrickWall.hpp, BrickWall.cpp).
	‚Ä¢	Every output must end with a newline character.

Coding style:
	‚Ä¢	No strict enforcement, but code must be clean and readable.

Allowed / Forbidden
	‚Ä¢	Allowed:
	‚Ä¢	Almost everything from the standard C++ library.
	‚Ä¢	Forbidden:
	‚Ä¢	printf(), malloc(), calloc(), realloc(), free()
	‚Ä¢	using namespace <ns_name>
	‚Ä¢	friend keyword
	‚Ä¢	STL (until Modules 08 and 09)

Design Requirements
	‚Ä¢	Avoid memory leaks (especially when using new).
	‚Ä¢	Classes must follow the Orthodox Canonical Form (Module 02 to 09).
	‚Ä¢	No function implementations in headers (except templates).
	‚Ä¢	Use include guards to prevent double inclusion.

Additional Notes
	‚Ä¢	You can add extra files to organize your code.
	‚Ä¢	Always read the full module before starting.
	‚Ä¢	Think carefully and read examples!

Makefile:
Follow the same rules as in C.

‚∏ª

III. Exercise 00: Polymorphism
	‚Ä¢	Turn-in directory: ex00/
	‚Ä¢	Files to turn in: Makefile, main.cpp, *.cpp, *.{h,hpp}
	‚Ä¢	Forbidden functions: None

Task

Create:
	‚Ä¢	A Animal class with a protected attribute:
	‚Ä¢	std::string type
	‚Ä¢	A Dog class that inherits from Animal.
	‚Ä¢	A Cat class that inherits from Animal.

Set the type field appropriately (‚ÄúDog‚Äù or ‚ÄúCat‚Äù).

Public Member Functions:
	‚Ä¢	makeSound(): Outputs the animal‚Äôs sound (cats do not bark).

Example:
int main()
{
    const Animal* meta = new Animal();
    const Animal* j = new Dog();
    const Animal* i = new Cat();
    std::cout << j->getType() << " " << std::endl;
    std::cout << i->getType() << " " << std::endl;
    i->makeSound();
    j->makeSound();
    meta->makeSound();
    return 0;
}
Additionally, implement:
	‚Ä¢	WrongAnimal and WrongCat classes to demonstrate incorrect polymorphism behavior.

Create more tests than the given examples.

IV. Exercise 01: I don‚Äôt want to set the world on fire
	‚Ä¢	Turn-in directory: ex01/
	‚Ä¢	Files to turn in: Files from previous exercise + new *.cpp, *.{h,hpp}
	‚Ä¢	Forbidden functions: None

Task

Create a Brain class with an array of 100 std::string called ideas.
	‚Ä¢	Dog and Cat classes will have a private Brain* attribute.
	‚Ä¢	Dogs and Cats:
	‚Ä¢	new Brain() upon construction
	‚Ä¢	delete Brain upon destruction
	‚Ä¢	Deep copy must be performed when copying.

Main Example:
int main()
{
    const Animal* j = new Dog();
    const Animal* i = new Cat();
    delete j;
    delete i;
    return 0;
}
Also:
	‚Ä¢	Create an array of Animal* (half Dogs, half Cats).
	‚Ä¢	Delete each Animal directly through an Animal*.
	‚Ä¢	Check for memory leaks.

Add more tests to verify deep copies.

‚∏ª

V. Exercise 02: Abstract class
	‚Ä¢	Turn-in directory: ex02/
	‚Ä¢	Files to turn in: Files from previous exercise + new *.cpp, *.{h,hpp}
	‚Ä¢	Forbidden functions: None

Task

Make the Animal class abstract to prevent instantiation.
	‚Ä¢	Introduce at least one pure virtual function (e.g., makeSound()).
	‚Ä¢	Keep existing functionality intact.
	‚Ä¢	(Optionally rename Animal to AAnimal for clarity.)

‚∏ª

VI. Exercise 03: Interface & Recap
	‚Ä¢	Turn-in directory: ex03/
	‚Ä¢	Files to turn in: Makefile, main.cpp, *.cpp, *.{h,hpp}
	‚Ä¢	Forbidden functions: None

Task

Implement a Materia system inspired by RPGs.

‚∏ª

Step 1: Define AMateria
class AMateria {
protected:
    std::string type;
public:
    AMateria(std::string const& type);
    virtual ~AMateria();
    std::string const& getType() const;
    virtual AMateria* clone() const = 0;
    virtual void use(ICharacter& target);
};
Step 2: Concrete Materia classes
	‚Ä¢	Ice: "ice"
	‚Ä¢	Cure: "cure"

Their use() must output:
	‚Ä¢	Ice: * shoots an ice bolt at <name> *
	‚Ä¢	Cure: * heals <name>'s wounds *

Their clone() must return a new object of their type.

‚∏ª

Step 3: Define ICharacter
class ICharacter {
public:
    virtual ~ICharacter() {}
    virtual std::string const& getName() const = 0;
    virtual void equip(AMateria* m) = 0;
    virtual void unequip(int idx) = 0;
    virtual void use(int idx, ICharacter& target) = 0;
};
	‚Ä¢	Characters have 4 inventory slots for Materias.
	‚Ä¢	equip() fills the first available slot.
	‚Ä¢	unequip() does not delete the Materia.
	‚Ä¢	Copying Characters must perform deep copies.

‚∏ª

Step 4: Define MateriaSource
class IMateriaSource {
public:
    virtual ~IMateriaSource() {}
    virtual void learnMateria(AMateria*) = 0;
    virtual AMateria* createMateria(std::string const& type) = 0;
};
	Store up to 4 Materias.
	‚Ä¢	learnMateria() stores a Materia copy.
	‚Ä¢	createMateria() generates a new copy based on type.

‚∏ª

Step 5: Final Main Example
int main()
{
    IMateriaSource* src = new MateriaSource();
    src->learnMateria(new Ice());
    src->learnMateria(new Cure());

    ICharacter* me = new Character("me");

    AMateria* tmp;
    tmp = src->createMateria("ice");
    me->equip(tmp);
    tmp = src->createMateria("cure");
    me->equip(tmp);

    ICharacter* bob = new Character("bob");

    me->use(0, *bob);
    me->use(1, *bob);

    delete bob;
    delete me;
    delete src;
    return 0;
}
Expected Output:
* shoots an ice bolt at bob *
* heals bob's wounds *
Note:
You can pass the module without completing Exercise 03.

VII. Submission and Peer Evaluation
	‚Ä¢	Submit through your Git repository.
	‚Ä¢	Only the files in your repository will be evaluated.
	‚Ä¢	Double-check the folder and file names carefully!

‚∏ª

Would you also like me to prepare a ready-to-go folder structure and Makefile template for Module 04 as well? üöÄ
It would help you get started super quickly!
